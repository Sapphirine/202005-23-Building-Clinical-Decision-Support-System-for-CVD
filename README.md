The prediction of cardiovascular disease has great significance for its prevention work. The clinical data information for different patients is difficult to be reasonably represented, also the time interval between events is different, which leads to problems such as difficult prediction. This paper proposes several algorithms based on electronic medical record data to study the risk prediction of cardiovascular disease. The model uses techniques such as neural network to characterize and learn the patient's historical electronic medical record data, which can not only effectively capture the time-series features of the electronic medical record data, but also consider the potential correlation between them, and ultimately improve cardiovascular disease risk prediction performance. The key result is that coronary artery related disease has a prominent influence on the prediction of cardiovascular disease risk.
